## Thanks

This package is based on Laravel Zero.

Laravel Zero was created by [Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro) and [Owen Voke](https://github.com/owenvoke), and is a micro-framework that provides an elegant starting point for your console application. It is an **unofficial** and customized version of Laravel optimized for building command-line applications.
